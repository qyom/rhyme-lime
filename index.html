                        [synth voice] Only God can judge me now
                        Only God baby, nobody else, nobody else
                        All you other motherfuckers get out my business

                        [Verse One: 2Pac]

                        Perhaps I was blind to the facts, stabbed in the back
                        I couldn't trust my own homies just a bunch a dirty rats
                        Will I, succeed, paranoid from the weed
                        And hocus pocus try to focus but I can't see
                        And in my mind I'ma blind man doin time
                        Look to my future cause my past, is all behind me
                        Is it a crime, to fight, for what is mine?
                        Everybody's dyin tell me what's the use of tryin
                        I've been Trapped since birth, cautious, cause I'm cursed
                        And fantasies of my family, in a hearse
                        And they say it's the white man I should fear
                        But, it's my own kind doin all the killin here
                        I can't lie, ain't no love for the other side
                        Jealousy inside, make em wish I died
                        Oh my Lord, tell me what I'm livin for
                        Everybody's droppin got me knockin on heaven's door
                        And all my memories, of seein brothers bleed
                        And everybody grieves, but still nobody sees
                        Recollect your thoughts don't get caught up in the mix
                        Cause the media is full of dirty tricks
                        Only God can judge me
